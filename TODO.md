# TODO

It's too early for a realistic list, but, soon:
- make it easier to use another image: don't expect pimake to be used to download it
- make it easier to use another image url: don't expect all downloads to be of raspberrypi.org uri schema 
- Better 'deploy': rip and burn images from sd cards with dd

- Settle on a v1.0.0

## v1.5

- (*) allow the tinkphone script to be called from anywhere so it can be added to the path
- how do I install software on linux
- optionally expect user to mount the .img
    - tinkphone.conf: no_mount=0
    - scripts/mount.sh, scripts/unmount.sh

## v2.0
- wvdial/usb_modeswitch.conf
- make the size of the image
    - configurable, calculated
    - "resize.zip" <eyeroll/>
